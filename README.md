## How do I choose between new and used golf balls?

Your decision hinges on skill level and budget priorities. Players with handicaps below 10 who can consistently control spin should invest in new urethane-covered balls to maximize short game performance. Higher handicappers losing multiple balls per round benefit more from "Mint 5A" used balls that cost 50-70% less while delivering identical distance and durability. The key is matching your investment to your ability to keep balls in play.

## What's the real difference between tour balls and value balls?

Tour balls use soft urethane covers that generate high spin rates around greens, giving skilled players precise control over trajectory and stopping power. Value balls typically feature ionomer covers that prioritize durability and distance over spin, making them ideal for recreational players who benefit more from straighter flights than workability. The performance gap matters most on short game shots—if you're not consistently hitting greens in regulation, the extra spin won't significantly impact your score.

## Can I trust golf ball condition grades from online retailers?

Reputable retailers use standardized grading systems where "Mint 5A" indicates no visible wear, "AAA" shows minimal cosmetic marks, and lower grades have increasing surface damage. The established players like LostGolfBalls and Golf Ball Planet have built businesses on accurate grading, since reputation drives repeat purchases. Start with a small test order to verify the retailer's standards match your expectations, then buy in bulk once you're confident.
